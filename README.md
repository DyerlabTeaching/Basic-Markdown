## Impetus

This is a description of the basic use of Markdown for scientific writing and integration with R and RStudio.  We will be using Markdown throughout the semester as the way to communicate data findings.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:

- Open and create a basic [Quarto](https://quarto.org) document in RStudio.
- Write textual content using basic markdown syntax.
- Insert images (local and remote) into basic documents.
- Integrate [R](https://cran.r-project.org) code into your document.

## Supporting Content

For this topic, there are the following resources.  These should get you up-to-speed on using Markdown in RStudio.  

- [Slides](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Markdown/slides.html) describing the rationale for Markdown and how to use it in RStudio where you can mix textual content with data, code, and output.  
- A longer [narrative](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Markdown/narrative.html) on the topic that goes into more depth than the slides that includes code and example output.
- A previous [Video](https://youtu.be/f50Hz92IyIQ) on Markdown and Notebooks in RStudio.
- External resources:  
  - A basic [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)  
  - A site based upon [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) with examples.
  - The official documentation for [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) (which is the main interface we will be using).

## Assessment

There is a single taskâ€”you will use Markdown to craft a resume for yourself.  

- The [homework](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Markdown/homework.html) describing crafting a Markdown version of your resume.
