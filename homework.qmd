## Markdown Homework

This homework will focus on you working with some general markdown syntax. Follow the instructions in this document and answer the questions (or do what is instructed) in this exact document. Once you are finished with the homework, use the Git tab and Commit your changes and push them up to GitHub to turn it in.

If you need a refresher on how that is done, jump over to the repository on Git & Github and take a look at those documents to remind you.

## Background

Markdown is a very simple way of taking some text and identifying specific features of it to be displayed in certain ways. For example, the content of this document from here to the top has a some meta data in the YAML section and in the body has a header, a paragraph, another header, and then this paragraph. Visually displayed, it looks like:

whereas if you set the editor to look at the source, you can see these header and the text elements are just regular text content with some hashtags to make things look certain fancy

The content is the exact same and if you like the visual editor over the source code one, then use that one.

## Plain Text

Follow the instructions below and add markdown as indicated.

1.  A paragraph of text that has at least one element that is italicized, one that is bold, and one that has text strikethrough.
2.  Make an ordered list of your favorite three movies.
3.  Change YOUR NAME HERE in the YAML to your actual name...
4.  Insert an appropriate (and fundy) giphy using the insert image command.
5.  Change this sentence to show as a Header 3 element.

## Computations

In the following sections, you'll need to add a chunk of code and answer the following questions.

1.  In R, add the number 42 to your favorite number.
2.  Do the same thing again but this time do not have the chunk show in the rendered HTML file.
